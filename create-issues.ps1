## Overview

Implement comprehensive security analysis features to detect potential security issues, verify digital signatures, and analyze certificates in installer packages.

## Current State

- ‚úÖ Basic file hash calculation exists
- ‚ùå No digital signature verification
- ‚ùå No certificate chain analysis
- ‚ùå No malware detection integration
- ‚ùå No security vulnerability scanning

## Requirements

### Digital Signature Analysis
- [ ] **Signature Verification**: Verify Authenticode signatures on PE files
- [ ] **Certificate Chain Validation**: Validate certificate chains
- [ ] **Timestamp Verification**: Check signature timestamps
- [ ] **Certificate Details**: Extract certificate information (issuer, subject, validity)
- [ ] **Revocation Checking**: Check certificate revocation status (CRL/OCSP)

### Security Scanning
- [ ] **File Hash Analysis**: Calculate and verify file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- [ ] **Entropy Analysis**: Detect packed or encrypted content
- [ ] **Suspicious Patterns**: Identify potentially malicious patterns
- [ ] **Known Malware Signatures**: Basic signature-based detection
- [ ] **Behavioral Indicators**: Detect suspicious installation behaviors

### Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] **Outdated Components**: Detect known vulnerable libraries
- [ ] **Weak Cryptography**: Identify weak encryption/hashing algorithms
- [ ] **Privilege Escalation**: Detect potential privilege escalation attempts
- [ ] **Registry Security**: Analyze registry modifications for security implications

### Trust Analysis
- [ ] **Publisher Verification**: Verify publisher identity
- [ ] **Reputation Scoring**: Basic reputation analysis
- [ ] **Trust Level Assessment**: Overall trust score calculation
- [ ] **Warning Generation**: Generate security warnings and recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies to Add
``````toml
# Cryptography and security
ring = "0.17"                    # Cryptographic operations
webpki = "0.22"                  # Certificate validation
webpki-roots = "0.25"            # Root certificate store
x509-parser = "0.15"             # X.509 certificate parsing

# Windows-specific security APIs
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["wincrypt", "wintrust"] }

# Entropy and analysis
entropy = "0.4"                  # Entropy calculation
yara = "0.20"                    # Pattern matching (optional)

# Hash algorithms
sha1 = "0.10"
sha2 = "0.10"
md5 = "0.7"
``````

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Security Features
1. Implement file hash calculation (SHA256, SHA1, MD5)
2. Basic digital signature verification
3. Certificate information extraction
4. Simple entropy analysis

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
1. Certificate chain validation
2. Revocation checking
3. Pattern-based malware detection
4. Behavioral analysis

### Phase 3: Integration and Reporting
1. Security report generation
2. HTML report integration
3. CLI security commands
4. API endpoints for security analysis

## Priority

**High** - Security analysis is a key differentiating feature for enterprise users
